Applify - Manage your job applications effortlessly 

Seeking a good position, job searches can take a long time. Applify provides a clean and intuitive dashboard to track all your applications. You can document, edit, or delete applications with ease, keeping your job search organized on your PC or laptop. 

Unlike typical web-based solutions, Applify is a standalone application that runs locally, independently, and reliably—giving you long-term control over your job application management.
